# Code of Conduct Hackerspace Tricity

Hackerspace Tricity is open and technology oriented space gathering all those, who want to grow, share knowledge and build amazing community.

We do our best to make HS3 friendly and safe environment for all, no matter their knowledge, skill, gender, orientation, disability, looks, ethnicity, age, religion or any other factor.
Most important for us is person and what they represent with their behaviour.

## Examples of behaviours that support building positive environment:
- Being nice to everyone
- Using friendly language
- Respecting views and experience of others
- Cooperation
- Getting and giving constructive feedback
- Showing empathy

## Examples of unacceptable behaviours:
- Using sexually explicit language
- Using inappropriate images (including avatars)
- Using inappropriate languages (including nicks)
- Spamming, flooding, trolling
- Personal attacks, humiliating others
- Publicly sharing personal information (without consent)
- Discussion on polarising topics (e.g.: politics)

## Goal of CoC
The goal of this Code of Conduct is to designate our community's culture. It is not a comprehensive list of do/do not's - just try to act in spirit of this document and be the best version of you.

We value many things that are outside technical expertise (like cooperation and support). Creating good atmosphere can be way more important than just providing a correct answer.
